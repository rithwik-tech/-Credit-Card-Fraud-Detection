Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains real-world credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The implementation is designed to address class imbalance and optimize model performance.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Includes techniques like handling missing values, scaling, and dealing with class imbalance using methods like:

Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE)

Undersampling

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes transaction patterns and class distributions.

Model Training: Implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks

Evaluation Metrics: Models are evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Interactive Notebook: Google Colab notebook provided for ease of use and experimentation.
